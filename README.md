# 3DTerrainMap
This project documents a step-by-step workflow to generate and compare 3D terrain maps using before and after elevation datasets and aerial imagery from the 2014 Oso landslide event in Washington State, USA. It uses ArcGIS Pro 3.2 and demonstrates best practices in elevation surface authoring and 3D scene design.
